Below is the README with which I enclosed this submission for Harvard's CS61 class (Fall 2016.)  Substantial credit is due
to Professors Eddie Koehler and Margo Seltzer, as well as their staff.   The entirety of the unit testing, check.pl, and
parser-tokenizer, helpers.c, were, in fact, provided by them, and the student's work, as one of the requirements, was the
addition the functionality to the provided starter code in sh61.c (only) in order to emulate the required Unix shell 
commands in that C source code file.

This package was developed in the provided Oracle VirtualBoxVM (Linux Ubuntu/ GCC compiler).  While enclosed are
executables, etc. within your own environment you may need to make changes.
